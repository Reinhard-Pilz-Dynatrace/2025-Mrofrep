## Implement Trace Context Propagation

### Introduction

You do not need to complete this section before attempting the next section as these 2 are mutually exclusive. If you are stuck here, you can attempt the next section and revisit this one anytime.

The "Processing Backend" is getting called via HTTP GET Request from your Backend Server - just not in a way that Auto Instrumentation is able to recognize that.

### ðŸ“Œ Your Task: Make outgoing HTTP Requests visible

Open up `order-backend/src/main/java/com/dtcookie/shop/backend/BackendServer.java`.

Find a method named `notifyProcessingBackend`. The usage `GETRequest` clearly hints, that an outgoing HTTP request is happening here

* Enrich that method with a custom OpenTelemetry Span
* Make sure you're using the correct Span Kind
* Don't forget to add semantic attributes. `HTTP_METHOD` and `HTTP_URL` will be sufficient for Dynatrace.
* Handle exceptions properly in case the outgoing call fails
* Ensure that the Trace Context is getting propagated. You may want to take another look into the lab guide for `Span Creation` for an example.

```java
public static void notifyProcessingBackend(Product product) throws Exception {
		
	GETRequest request = new GETRequest("http://order-quotes-" + System.getenv("GITHUB_USER") + ":" + "8090/quote");
	request.send();
}
```

### âœ… Verify results

* Restart your Demo Application
* Open up a recent `/place-order` trace
* Validate that the Backend Server indeed shows an outgoing HTTP call to the Python Service
